1. OVERVIEW
     INSPIDAS (Integrated Simulation Program In Dihedral Angle Space)
is a versatile molecular simulation program which enables us to
perform various types of simulations in the dihedral angle space
including the energy minimization and the normal mode analysis.
The main ingredients of INSPIDAS are the programs developed by
Go and coworkers, which features the rapid calculation of the first
and the second derivatives of the interaction energy with respect
to the dihedral angle.
     A speciall attenttion has been paid for making the program to be
user friendly. The main input that controls the program flow plays
a similar role with a command language such as UNIX: for instance,
reading a file
into the program is carried out by issuing a command 'READ' followed
by a name of a file from which data are read in as illustrated in the
example bellow. Such a structured input is made possible by the
use of an input processor called 'PARSER' which has been originally
written by M. Karplus and his coworkers and has been implemented in
CHARMM.
     INSPIDAS performs a 'TASK' or a series of TASKs each of which
corresponds to a particular portion of the integrated program
such as the minimization.
The TASKs which are included in the current version of the program
are following:

     PREIN    ---  prepares a PRECEP input given dihedral angles.
     PRECEP   ---  builds the primary structure of a protein and
                   reads in energy parameters.
     MINIM    ---  performes the energy minimization and calculates
                   the first and second derivatives of the energy.
     NMA      ---  diagonalizes the second derivative matrix

Further explanation of each task is given in the separate documents.

2. USER INPUT

     In order to run INSPIDAS, a user must supply an input data
which includes a series of TASKs described above.  A typical input
of INSPIDAS has a form illustrated bellow:

-------------------------------------------------------------------
  WRITE <name of the main output file> TITLE <title of the simulation>
  TASK1 SUBTASK1 -
        SUBTASK2 KEYWORD PARAMETER1 <value2> PARAMETER2 <value2>
  QUIT
  TASK2 SUBTASK1 -
        SUBTASK2 -
        SUBTASK3
  QUIT
  ] TASK3 SUBTASK1 -
  ]         KEYWORD PARAMETERS
  ] QUIT
  END
-------------------------------------------------------------------

General rules to be followed to make the input are:

1. An INSPIDAS input data consists of command lines.
2. A command line is made of TASKs, SUBTASKs, KEYWORDs and PARAMETERs.
   PARAMETERs are associated with their values.
3. A command line which begins with ']' is interpreted as a comment.
4. A command line can include as many as 2000 characters (blanks are
   counted as a character), and continuation of a line is
   specified by '-'.
5. The first command line must includes 'WRITE' followed by a
   name of a main output file and 'TITLE' followed by a title of
   the run. The line must be terminated by a '*' at the end.

3. Manuals

     The INSPIDAS manuals are classified into the three categories:
       1) users manual
       2) programers manual
       3) manual for residue data

- user's manual -

     The users manual helps users to make the INSPIDAS
input data for each TASK. The organization of the users manual is:
       1) Overview of the TASK
       2) Explanation of each TASK, SUBTASK, KEYWORD, and PARAMTERS
       3) EXAMPLE
Following manuals are currently available:
       PREIN, PRECEP, MINIM, NMA

- programers manual -

     The programers manual is intended to supply the information of
subroutines in each TASK to a person who is going to change the
program. The manual includes:

     1) a program tree of subroutines in the TASK
     2) a list and a brief explanation of subroutines
     3) a detailed explanation of each subroutine
        (i)   purpose
        (ii)  calling arguments
        (iii) algorithm
        (iv)  definitions of arrays and variables
        (v)   subroutine structure
     4) update notes
