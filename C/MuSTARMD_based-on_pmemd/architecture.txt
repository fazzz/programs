PMEMD Software Architecture Documentation

Introduction

    PMEMD, henceforth pmemd, is cleanly written; thus, since it is a 
self contained program, there is not a great need for code level
documentation such as is produced by javadoc.  However, there are many
preprocessor controlled code paths; a name translation table is in
the file ifdefs.
